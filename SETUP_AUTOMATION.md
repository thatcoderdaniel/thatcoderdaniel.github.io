# 🚀 Complete Automation Setup

I've prepared everything for automated deployment! You just need to create one service account key and add it to GitHub.

## 📝 Step 1: Create Service Account Key (2 minutes)

### Option A: Via GCP Console (Recommended)
1. Go to [GCP Console → IAM & Admin → Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=dmisblogging-prod)
2. Find `website-deploy@dmisblogging-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
3. Click the 3 dots → "Manage Keys"
4. Click "ADD KEY" → "Create new key" → JSON
5. Download the JSON file

### Option B: Via Command Line (If you have owner access)
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create github-actions-key.json \
    --iam-account=website-deploy@dmisblogging-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## 🔑 Step 2: Add GitHub Secret (1 minute)

1. Go to your GitHub repo: https://github.com/thatcoderdaniel/thatcoderdaniel.github.io
2. Click **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Name: `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`
5. Value: Copy and paste the **entire contents** of the JSON file you downloaded
6. Click **"Add secret"**

## ✅ Step 3: Test It! (Automatic)

The automation is already set up! Once you add the secret:

1. **Make any small change** (edit this file, or a blog post in TinaCMS)
2. **Commit to GitHub** (or TinaCMS will auto-commit)
3. **Watch GitHub Actions** tab in your repo
4. **Check your site** - should be live in ~2-3 minutes!

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### Every Time You:
- **Edit a post in TinaCMS** → TinaCMS commits → GitHub Actions triggers → Site deploys
- **Push to GitHub** → GitHub Actions triggers → Site deploys
- **Make any change** → Automated deployment!

### You'll See:
- ✅ Green checkmarks in GitHub Actions
- 📊 Full build logs and status
- 🚀 Changes live on https://itsdanmanole.com

## 🛠️ Monitoring & Status

### Check Deployment Status:
- **GitHub**: Repository → Actions tab
- **Logs**: Click any workflow run to see detailed logs
- **Site**: https://itsdanmanole.com

### If Something Fails:
- Check the GitHub Actions logs
- Your manual `./deploy.sh` still works as backup
- All errors will show in the Actions tab

## 🎉 That's It!

Once you add the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` secret, your blog will automatically deploy every time you make changes. No more manual `./deploy.sh` needed!

**Test it:** Make a small change to any file and push to GitHub. Watch the magic happen in the Actions tab! ✨
