# Readwise Integrations

I have combined Readwise with Tweets, Kindle, Obsidian Sync and Reader. Whatever I highlight in Reader, Kindle, or on the internet, I can send it straight to my Readwise, which will then sync right back to Obsidian.

I paid $5 (Monthly) to Obsidian so it syncs my vault on the phone as well.

This will allow me to have a constant flow through my devices. Storage limit is 1GB, will have to see if that's enough. Perhaps, when adding videos, I can rely on Youtube. I doubt that I will have many documents that are storage heavy.

# Finished "Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter"

The book has been amazing. I will have to go back to it and distill each lesson. 50 has a natural way of teaching, which resonates with me.

# Completed Yearly Review of My 30 Taken Notes

On Supernote, I wrote 30 notes in the span of two months. Going through them, allowed me to recall every single emotions, and ideas (most importantly), that I had in these moments.

I then capture all of them in [[30.pdf]], which is now accessible in **Obsidian**. The flow with **Obsidian** is working perfectly thus far.
