Now that I failed the most important pivot of my life. It is time to recalibrate myself and keep moving forward. I may have lost the fight, but the war is not over. It will not be over, until it is over.

Life has been consistently knocking me down.
Giving high hopes.
And knocked me down with 2x momentum.

But nobody cares about your feelings.
Not even your own self.
You want to feel sorry? Guess what. Nobody cares.

Anyway. At this point. What can I do?
Life will knock me and I'll fight back.
So what's next?

### Achieve a win

let's put it as it is for now:

Daniel, a Cloud Support Engineer.
He's going towards a 6 years career.
3 of those were in Enterprise Support.
The other 3 have all been centered in the Cloud.

How can I leverage that experience to show it the right way.
I know I've got what it takes. Hell, I know I've got a special gem in my soul. Ready to use it to the best of its ability to excel where I feel most alive.
WHERE DO U FEEL MOST ALIVE?
In the realm of projects.
Where one seems ambiguous at first.
You start untangling the spider webs by listening.
Listening to the person's pain points.
Your curiosity is kicking in now. But so does your creativity.
You are already boiling down ideas on the best path forward.
You're going internally, to chase the goose.
The golden goose who will make this outcome progress.
You align everything, and everyone, to get this person moving forward.
You stay after hours to master subjects you haven't seen before.
You double down on what you know and refine with newer knowledge.
This is what I strive for.
Being there for others. Learning constantly. And reaching levels that somehow always seemed impossible at first.

### Actual Planning

Cloud Solution Architect <- Get this cert. Period.
Get projects going. I want to see you posting some crazy shit.
I am talking 3-tier architectures where you're hosting a bunch of ideas.
Get that Blog going, in a Cloud vendor. Go with Google.
POST POST POST. You heard that? Post on LinkedIn. Show your work. With PRIDE!
You know what. POST ON YOUTUBE.
YOU KNOW WHAT. Post on the Gram.
Make your passion SCREAM!
Make that journey begin.
Make every second of it worth it.
After your 9 to 5, your 6 to 10 begins.
Let that be your testament to what you can achieve.

### Rules

- Limited talking.
- When writing, remove ANY words that are not serving your context.
- Action, Learn, Repeat. (NO TALKING)
- 1 RECORDING / WEEK

When do you get that certification Daniel? Timeline, now.
Let's go with three months. But can be revisited. But can't pass 3 months.
